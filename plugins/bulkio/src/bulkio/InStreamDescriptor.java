    * @brief  Base class for input and output streams.
    *
    * %StreamBase is a smart-pointer based class that encapsulates a single
    * BulkIO stream. It implements the basic common API for input and output
    * streams, providing accessor methods for StreamSRI fields.
    *
    * @note  User code should typically use the type-specific input and output
    *        stream classes.
