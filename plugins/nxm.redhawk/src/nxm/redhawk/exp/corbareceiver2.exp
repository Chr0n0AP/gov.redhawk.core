CORBARECEIVER2 - Output data from a REDHAWK Port to Midas file/pipe

<FILE>      - Name of the Midas output file/pipe (destination)
<IOR>       - CORBA IOR to Port (source)
<IDL>       - CORBA IDL for Port (type of data)
<STREAMID>  - Stream ID to let data through (ignore all other streams)

Examples:

Switches:
  /BLOCKING - Block pushPacket(..) call when pipe does not have enough room.
              Set to false to not block (which will drop data packet when pipe
              is full). Deprecated since 11.0                       [DEF=false]
  /BLOCKINGOPTION= - Blocking option for pushPacket(..) call when pipe does
                   not have enough room:             (Since 11.0) [DEF=FromSRI]
                     BLOCKING or TRUE - block pushPacket call until there is
                                        room to write to the pipe.
                     NONBLOCKING or FALSE - drop data if pipe is full.
                     FROMSRI - use setting from StreamSRI.blocking (true/false)
  /CONNECTIONID= - Connection ID to use to connect to Port           [DEF=auto]
  /GROWPIPE      - enable/disable increasing/growing output file's pipe size
                   when incoming data packet size is larger than it. [DEF=true]
  /PSMULT=       - If /GROWPIPE=true, increase  pipe size based on this
                   multiplier * incoming data packet size.              [DEF=4]
  /SAMPLERATE=   - override sample rate (0 to base on StreamSRI)        [DEF=0]
  /UNSIGNEDOCTET - treat BULKIO dataOctet as 8-bit unsigned integer which will
                   upcast format type to 16-bit signed integer (i.e. SI) to
                   hold data values)                                [DEF=false]
  /WAIT=n        - milliseconds to wait for a StreamSRI during open  [DEF=1000]
